                    <h3> What is Machine Learning</h3>
                    <p>This introduction to machine learning provides an overview of its history, important definitions,
                        applications and concerns within businesses today.</p>

                    <div class = "horizontal-line"></div>
                    <p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on
                        the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
                       IBM has a rich history with machine learning. One of its own, Arthur Samuel, is credited for coining
                        the term, “machine learning” with his research (PDF, 481 KB) (link resides outside IBM) around the game of
                        checkers. Robert Nealey, the self-proclaimed checkers master, played the game on an IBM 7094 computer in 1962,
                        and he lost to the computer. Compared to what can be done today, this feat almost seems trivial, but it’s
                        considered a major milestone within the field of artificial intelligence. Over the next couple of decades,
                        the technological developments around storage and processing power will enable some innovative products that
                        we know and love today, such as Netflix’s recommendation engine or self-driving cars. </p>

                            <p>Much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface. Machine learning
                                drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals
                                recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more.
                                Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type - quietly
                                but meaningfully improving core operations.</p>

                    <h3>Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks </h3>
                    <p class="post p"> Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting the
                        nuances between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields
                        of artificial intelligence. However, deep learning is actually a sub-field of machine learning,
                        and neural networks is a sub-field of deep learning.</p>
                    <p class="post p"> "Deep" machine learning can leverage labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning,
                        to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. It can ingest unstructured
                        data in its raw form (e.g. text, images), and it can automatically determine the set of features which
                        distinguish different categories of data from one another. Unlike machine learning, it doesn't require human
                        intervention to process data, allowing us to scale machine learning in more interesting ways. Deep learning
                        and neural networks are primarily credited with accelerating progress in areas, such as computer vision,
                        natural language processing, and speech recognition.</p>

                    <h3>How machine learning works </h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification.
                            Based on some input data, which can be labelled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about
                            a pattern in the data.
                        </li>
                            <li>An Error Function: An error function serves to evaluate the prediction of the model. If there are known
                                examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.
                            </li>
                            <li> An Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then
                                weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate.
                                The algorithm will repeat this evaluate and optimize process, updating weights autonomously until a
                                threshold of accuracy has been met.
                            </li>
